--How to run the program:

--The program should be run by executing the Main.exe file from the command line with two paramters.
--The first one is the grammar input file, the second one is the words input file.
--The program will convert the given grammar to CNF, and determine whether a word is in the language generated by the grammar, using the CYK algorythm.
--The output should be displayed on the console. It will display the words read from the file, the converted grammar and a list of
--boolean values indicating if the word at the corresponding position is in the language or not.

--how to run: cmd>Main grammar.txt words.txt


--Format of the "grammar" input file:

--The format of the content is really strict, so don't miss anything.
--The fist line contains the start symbol, empty word symbol nonterminal symbols and the terminal symbols.
--As you can see, after the start and empty symbols there are semicolons. It is also true for nonterminals and terminals,
--but the nonterminals and terminals themselves are separated by a simple comma.
--At the end of the line there is no sperarator. (It is also true for all lines, even the last line, because that line does not end with new line tag. (\n))
--The rules of the grammar should be written from the second line, in the following format:
--Every line starts with the left-hand side of the rule followed by "->" sign and the list of words.
--Each word separated by "|" sign, and if the word contains multiple symbols, than those are separated by colon from each other.
--As you can see, these lines end only with new line symbols (\n), except the last line.
--One important thing is that a whole string can represent a single symbol. That's why you have to separate the symbols with commas. 


--Common mistakes:
--First line semicolon, colon mismatch,...
--Line endings.
--No new line signs at the end of the rule line (except last line)


{- Possible input:
S;epszilon;A,B,C,D,S;a,b,epszilon
S->a,A|a,D|b,C|epszilon
A->a,B|b,A|b,C
-}




--Format of the "words" input file:

--Each line should contain a single word, consisting of the any number of symbols
--The symbols within a word should be separated by commas.
--Each line should have a newline character at the end of it, except the last one.
